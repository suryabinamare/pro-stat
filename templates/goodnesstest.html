  Goodness of Fit Test
</h1>


    <p class = "left-aligned"> A goodness of fit test is a statistical test used to determine how well a set of observed data 
        matches the expected distribution of a population. It essentially checks whether the sample data comes from a 
        particular theoretical distribution (such as normal, binomial, or Poisson). By comparing the observed frequencies 
        with the expected frequencies, the test helps identify if deviations are due to random chance or if they suggest 
        that the assumed distribution is not a good fit. One of the most commonly used goodness of fit tests is the Chi-square test, 
        which is widely applied in hypothesis testing and model validation.

        <h3 class = "left-aligned">An example:  </h3>  

        <p class = "left-aligned">Suppose we have a six-sided die, and we want to test if it is fair (i.e., each side 
          has an equal probability of landing face up). We roll the die 150 times and record the following outcomes:
            <img src = "{{url_for('static', filename = 'die.png')}}" alt = "Die Rolls" width = "200" height = "150">
            

        <ul>
            <li><b>Sides : Observed frequencies</b></li>
            <li>Side 1: 23 times</li>
            <li>Side 2: 26 times</li>
            <li>Side 3: 23 times</li>
            <li>Side 4: 21 times</li>
            <li>Side 5: 31 times</li>
            <li>Side 6: 26 times</li>
        </ul>
        Do the data provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the die is not fair? The above data  which shows the observed 
        frequencies of each side of the die after 150 rolls. 
          <ul> 
            <li> \(H_0\): The die is fair (i.e., all sides have equal probability)</li>
            <li> \(H_1\): The die is not fair (i.e., at least one side has a different probability)</li>
          </ul>

       <p class = "left-aligned"> If the die were fair, we expect equal number of rolls for each side, which would be 150/6 = 25 rolls per side.
        So expected frequencies are:</p>
        <ul>
             <li><b>Sides : Expected frequencies</b></li>
            <li>Side 1: 25 times</li>
            <li>Side 2: 25 times</li>
            <li>Side 3: 25 times</li>
            <li>Side 4: 25 times</li>
            <li>Side 5: 25 times</li>
            <li>Side 6: 25 times</li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "left-aligned"> We compare the observed and expected frequencies. If observed frequencies are close to expected frequencies,
        we may say that the die is fair. If they differ significantly, we may conclude that the die is not fair.
        We take the difference between observed and expected frequencies for each side:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Side 1: 23 - 25 = -2</li>
            <li>Side 2: 26 - 25 = 1</li>
            <li>Side 3: 23 - 25 = -2</li>
            <li>Side 4: 21 - 25 = -4</li>
            <li>Side 5: 31 - 25 = 6</li>
            <li>Side 6: 26 - 25 = 1</li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "left-aligned"> We then square these differences to eliminate negative values and emphasize larger discrepancies:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Side 1: (-2)^2 = 4</li>
            <li>Side 2: (1)^2 = 1</li>
            <li>Side 3: (-2)^2 = 4</li>
            <li>Side 4: (-4)^2 = 16</li>
            <li>Side 5: (6)^2 = 36</li>
            <li>Side 6: (1)^2 = 1</li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "left-aligned"> Then we divide each squared difference by the expected frequency for that side:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Side 1: 4 / 25 = 0.16</li>
            <li>Side 2: 1 / 25 = 0.04</li>
            <li>Side 3: 4 / 25 = 0.16</li>
            <li>Side 4: 16 / 25 = 0.64</li>
            <li>Side 5: 36 / 25 = 1.44</li>
            <li>Side 6: 1 / 25 = 0.04</li>
        </ul>

        <p class = "left-aligned"> Finally, we sum these values to get the chi-square statistic:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chi-square statistic = 0.16 + 0.04 + 0.16 + 0.64 + 1.44 + 0.04 = 2.48</li>
        </ul>

        <p class = "left-aligned"> This random variable follows a chi-square distribution with (k - 1) degrees of freedom, where k is
        the number of categories (sides of the die). In this case, k = 6, so we have 5 degrees of freedom.
        So, we can compare our chi-square statistic (2.48) to the critical value from the chi-square distribution.
        For a significance level of 0.05, the critical value is approximately 11.07.
        Intuitively speaking, as long as our chi-square statistic is less than the critical value,
        the observed frequencies are close enough to the expected frequencies that we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
        We conclude that there is not enough evidence to suggest that the die is not fair.
        More formally, we can say that the p-value associated with our chi-square statistic (2.48) is greater than 0.05,
        indicating that we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level.</p>

        <p class = "left-aligned"> In conclusion, the chi-square goodness of fit test suggests that the die is fair,
        as the observed frequencies do not significantly differ from the expected frequencies.</p>
